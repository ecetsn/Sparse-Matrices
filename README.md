# Sparse Matrix Operations

Sparse matrices are a special type of data structure where most of the values are zero. These matrices find applications in various fields, such as graphics, simulations, and neural networks, due to their memory-efficient representation. This project implements operations on sparse matrices using a two-dimensional linked list data structure.

## Overview

This project provides a C++ implementation of various operations on sparse matrices, including:

**Reading a Sparse Matrix:** Reading a sparse matrix from a text file and storing it as a 2D linked list.

**Printing a Sparse Matrix:** Printing the sparse matrix to the console, including zero values.

**Deleting a Sparse Matrix:** Deallocating memory associated with a sparse matrix.

**Checking Symmetry:** Determining if a sparse matrix is symmetric.

**Transpose:** Finding the transpose of a sparse matrix.

**Adding Sparse Matrices:** Adding two sparse matrices of the same dimensions.

## Implementation Details
This project employs a 2D linked list data structure to represent sparse matrices. It uses two types of nodes: row_node and cell_node. These nodes are linked together to create the matrix's structure efficiently.

The provided main.cpp file contains a sample program that demonstrates how to use the implemented functions to perform operations on sparse matrices.
